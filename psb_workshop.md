Workshop Organizers

Rui Duan, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health. Her research interests focus on developing statistical and machine
learning methods for effective use of biomedical data, in order to generate reliable
evidence and knowledge that enable precise and accurate diagnostics, support clinical
decision making, and optimize individualized treatments. Specifically, her lab focuses on
predictive models based on electronic health records (EHR) and EHR-linked biobanks,
federated learning and meta-analysis methods for effective evidence synthesis and data
integration, and methods to account for suboptimality of real-world data, including missing
data and measurement errors.

Lifang He, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at Lehigh University. Her group focuses on developing advanced
computational methods for biomedical research such as on understanding disease
mechanisms, diagnosis, prognosis, disease biomarkers, and disease pathways. Her
research interests broadly include machine learning computational medical imaging, AI
for health, tensor computing, and multimodal analysis.

Ruowang Li, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computational
Biomedicine at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. His lab focuses on developing
computational methods to extract knowledge from large-scale population-level data, such
as biobank-linked electronic health record data. His area of research includes multi-omics
data integration, federated learning of patients’ data, genetic risk prediction, and genomephenome
associations.

Jason H. Moore, Ph.D. is a biomedical informatician and founding Chair of the
Department of Computational Biomedicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. His research on artificial intelligence methods for the analysis of biomedical data
has been continuously funded the NIH for more than 20 years. He has been a pioneer in
the development of automated machine learning methods for risk prediction in populationbased
studies and samples derived from electronic health records. He is an elected fellow
of the American College of Medical Informatics, the International Academy of Health
Sciences Informatics, the American Statistical Association, the International Statistics
Institute, and the American Association for Advancement of Science. He is Editor-in-Chief
of the open-access journal BioData Mining.
