# AI for Health: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Revolutionize Healthcare (PSB 2026)


## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to transform healthcare, offering groundbreaking capabilities in disease diagnosis, treatment, drug discovery, and patient care. By improving access to health services, reducing costs, and addressing workforce shortages, AI can play a pivotal role in tackling global health challenges.

Successfully integrating AI into healthcare, however, requires careful consideration of regulatory frameworks, governance structures, data equity, and privacy protections. As interest in applying AI to healthcare grows, close collaboration between academia, clinical practitioners, and the healthcare industry becomes increasingly crucial to ensure that AI technologies are inclusive, equitable, and ethical.

This workshop will bring together AI researchers, clinicians, and industry experts to foster dialogues and insights that contribute to responsible AI development. Focus areas will include:

- AI for medical data analysis  
- Clinical decision support systems  
- Drug discovery  
- Personalized medicine  
- Digital health platforms  

All of these areas promise to reshape the future of health services.

Tiffani Bright is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biomedicine at Cedars-Sinai and Co-Director of the Center for AI Research and Education. Her lab works to reduce bias in machine learning, ensuring clinical AI models treat all patients fairly. They enhance AutoML tools such as TPOT to automate bias detection and mitigation, making fair model development more scalable. Instead of traditional proxies like race, they design predictive models based on fairer metrics to promote equitable healthcare outcomes.
